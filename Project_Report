ADGM Corporate Agent — Document Reviewer

Project Overview
This project is implemented in Google Colab and serves as an AI-assisted Corporate Agent for reviewing and validating legal documentation within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) framework.

The system takes .docx legal files as input, verifies them against the ADGM compliance checklist, detects missing documents, and highlights red flag issues. It then produces:

A structured JSON report summarizing the review.

An annotated .docx file containing inline comments and compliance suggestions.

The intent is to assist companies, law firms, or individuals in preparing correct documentation for incorporation and related ADGM processes.

How It Works

The solution in the .ipynb notebook is broken into clear, sequential steps:

- Library Installation — All required Python packages are installed at the beginning to ensure the environment is ready to run on Colab without manual setup.

- Reference Data Preparation — A simplified ADGM checklist and sample compliance rules are loaded (in real deployment, this would be linked to actual ADGM official sources).

- Document Parsing — .docx files are read, and their content is split into manageable text chunks for analysis.

- Process Identification — The system automatically determines the type of process (e.g., Company Incorporation) based on the document set.

- Checklist Verification — Uploaded files are compared against the list of required documents; missing files are flagged.

- Red Flag Detection — The text is scanned for issues such as:

- Wrong jurisdiction (e.g., “UAE Federal Courts” instead of ADGM Courts).

    Ambiguous or non-binding clauses.

    Missing signatories or witness sections.

    Incorrect formatting or non-compliance with ADGM templates.

- Output Generation — The results are compiled into:

     A downloadable .docx with inline comments.

    A JSON report listing findings, severity, and recommendations.

- Interactive UI — A Gradio interface is provided for easy testing and demonstration.

Test Cases

The notebook contains built-in test case generators. These create sample documents with intentional compliance issues for demonstration: (Used test cases for speed)

- Articles of Association — Contains wrong jurisdiction, missing minority shareholder rights, and vague clauses.

- Memorandum of Association — Contains non-binding terms and missing signature details.

- Running the Test Case option in Gradio will:

    Generate these files in memory.

    Run them through the same review process.

    Output both the JSON report and annotated .docx files for download.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the Project
1) Open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab.

2) Execute all cells from top to bottom.

3) When the Gradio interface launches, click “Run Built-in Test Case”.

4) View the JSON report on the left and download reviewed .docx files from the links on the right.

Deliverables

The project produces:

- JSON Report — Summary of compliance checks, missing documents, and issues.

- Annotated .docx — Inline comments referencing ADGM compliance rules.

Self-contained Demo — No paid APIs, works entirely in Colab with preloaded test data.

Sample Outputs
For reference, annotated .docx files from the test cases can be found as part of this repo.
These show the inline comments and changes the system suggests based on ADGM compliance rules.
